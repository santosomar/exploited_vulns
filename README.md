# Exploited Vulns Automation POC
My goal is to create a few scripts to pull and process CVE information and respective data from [CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).

## Pre-requisites

Install the required modules:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
exploited.py  -h   
usage: exploited.py [-h] [--cve SEARCHED_CVE] [-v VENDOR] [-p PRODUCT] [-e]

Omar's Client for the CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --cve SEARCHED_CVE    Searches for a given CVE.
  -v VENDOR, --vendor VENDOR
                        Searches for an affected vendor.
  -p PRODUCT, --product PRODUCT
                        Searches for an affected product.
